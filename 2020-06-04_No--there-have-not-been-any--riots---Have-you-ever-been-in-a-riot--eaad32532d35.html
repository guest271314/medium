<section name="71df" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="5215" id="5215" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--leading">They are riots</blockquote><p name="d35b" id="d35b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">No, there have not been any “riots”. Have you ever been in a riot?</p><p name="ebe4" id="ebe4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What you are observing is immutable disgust with the United States, and the Sovereign States which form the Union, the entirety of _their_ “system”. The history is irrefutable, from inception to today.</p><blockquote name="7271" id="7271" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">and everyone enabling them are criminals.</blockquote><p name="6475" id="6475" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Yes. That applies to the United States as well. From the Constitutional Conventions, to the organic Constitution for the United States; Monroe Doctrine; Indian Removal Act of 1831; Manifest Destiny; DAPL; et al. Neither United States, nor any of its Citizens, has any moral position to charge anyone else for being “criminals”, when the United States is a criminal organization itself; that has broken over 500 treaties with the Sovereign Nations of Turtle Island; voided Sherman’s Special Orders, №15, etc.</p><blockquote name="d4fe" id="d4fe" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">What happened to George Floyd is a tragedy, but it’s far from the norm.</blockquote><p name="97d0" id="97d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">How did you reach that conclusion? 99 years ago the State dropped firebombs from aircraft on Greenwood, Oklahoma. 99 years before that prisoner of war (so-called “slave”)“farms” were thriving in Maryland. 99 years before that Virginia Colony took the vote from so-called “Free Blacks” with deliberate intention of placing a perpetual brand on those individuals; 50 years before that “White-women” were created by legislative fiat in Maryland Colony, referring to the formerly termed “ffreeborne English women” who dared marry an African or “Free Black”.</p><p name="e42d" id="e42d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In short, the entire history of the United States proves unequivocally that so-called “Negroes”, “Blacks”, or “African Americans” were not intended to be and are not now Citizens of the United States. The United States has only exploited and mistreated that political class “Negroes”, “Blacks”, “African American”, lied, stolen their native tongue, by force.</p><p name="0a92" id="0a92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why would any so-called “black” person believe anything the United States says at this point? Where they could have drawn the same conclusion 200 years ago. Only those so-called “blacks” can supply their own “Justice”, it is impossible for that class to achieve “Justice” within the system of the United States, as the scientific method proves.</p><blockquote name="4019" id="4019" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">How many black people die in car accidents every day? Are we rioting over the car makers not making cars safer?</blockquote><p name="9707" id="9707" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">That comparison is misleading. The acts by white supremacists, and as a military-industrial white supremacist organization, that includes the U.S., are deliberate and are intended to dominate and mistreat people who <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">they </em>arbitrarily classify politically as non-”white”, they mistreat for sport and to sustain the ongoing conquest.</p><p name="4bf6" id="4bf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The “cup runneth over”, as a religious person might say. Or, the geenie is not going back in the bottle. There is zero reason to trust anything the U.S. says.</p><blockquote name="b782" id="b782" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">How many black people die every day from intercity/gang violence? Are we rioting over all the black-on-black murders that happen?</blockquote><p name="709c" id="709c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Who is “we”? Again, there have not been any so-called “riots”. There has been expression of raw disgust with the regime, and the apologists therefore.</p><p name="d43b" id="d43b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So-called “blacks” might simply not possess the necesary courage, focused in the correct direction, to form their own nation.</p><p name="b094" id="b094" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Going back to Virginia Colony taking the vote of so-called “Free Blacks” in 1723, one of the accusations made, or at least articulated by Gooch, is that the “Free Blacks” were discussing breaking away from the English (“White” was a relatively new invention at that point, Englishmen and Englishwomen being used far more in primary sources; later many tried to re-write history and insert “white” where not found in original documents) which, ironically, those same English accusers would do themselves some 50 years later, and are still applauding themselves for their “self-determination”, as if self-determination ended for all future generations when Englishmen decided to exercise that right, and break free entirely of their oppressor.</p><blockquote name="e910" id="e910" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">There is plenty of racism out there, I’m with you, I hear you.</blockquote><p name="02b0" id="02b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">No, you are not really “with” those people, nor do you “hear” them when you follow with a “But”. You don’t get it. People are over being lied to, when they can see for themselves the truth. Why listen? Why even ask? So-called “Black” people can make up their own minds without asking some absentee entity that has been nothing but brutal to them — and lied to them, over and over again. And never ask, or beg for “Justice” or mercy again.</p><blockquote name="65fe" id="65fe" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">But to go to the streets to loot</blockquote><p name="82b0" id="82b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The Boston Tea Party must not a noble act of defiance to you?</p><p name="7bf2" id="7bf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">By the way, that event occurred on an East India Company ship. The U.S. national flag would eventually be modelled, on that pre-existing flag. The same stripes are still on the U.S. national flag. The East India Company, like the fledgling U.S. were pirates, convicts, kidnapped children, prisoners of war, shipped from all over the world to one of the human trafficking capitols of the world: The Colonies of America which, after several mergers and acquisitions, became the conglomerate United States.</p><blockquote name="4305" id="4305" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">because you’re mad, thats not only criminal, its disrespectful to the memory of those who have lost their lives at the hands of the people you’re protesting against.</blockquote><p name="2019" id="2019" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">You don’t get it. You don not get to determine what “disrespect” means, nor when it applies. The U.S. has done nothing but “disprespect” the original Sovereign Nations and People of Turtle Island; the peasants from Europe swindled into bonded labor contracts; prisoners of war from Europe, African and around the world human-trafficked to the Colonie and later U.S. using at the time the advanced ship-building region in the world.</p><p name="e48a" id="e48a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Europeans looted the entire Americas. And still have the audacity to think they stole it fair and sqaure and it’s a settled matter.</p><p name="b90f" id="b90f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">By the way, the continuously compound interest on the unpaid and unsettled debt to prisoners of war forced labor camps, romatically called “the Several States”, is still accruing.</p></div></div></section>
