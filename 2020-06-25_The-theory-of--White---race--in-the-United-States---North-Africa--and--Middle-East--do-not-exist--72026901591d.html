The cause must be sought for in the peculiar texture of their bodies, or in the seed, or in the blood-which last are, however, of the same colour as everywhere else. 3. Their skin,<br>which is oily, smooth, and polished, excepting the places which are burnt with the sun. 4. The three or four hairs of beard. 5. Their hair, which is not properly hair, but rather a species of wool, which comes<br>near the hairs of some of our dogs; and, finally, their teeth whiter than the finest ivory, their tongue and all the interior of their mouth and their lips as red as coral.</blockquote><p name="2fb1" id="2fb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Later we find “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">white races</em>” and “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">white race</em>” in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races</em> by Arthur de Gobineau (1853–1855)</p><blockquote name="72bf" id="72bf" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The white races are, further, distinguished by an extraordinary attachment to life. They know better how to use it, and so, as it would seem, set a greater price on it; both in their own persons and those of others, they are more sparing of life. When they are cruel, they are conscious of their cruelty; it is very doubtful whether such a consciousness exists in the negro. At the same time, they have discovered reasons why they should surrender this busy life of theirs, that is so precious to them. The principal motive is honour, which<br>under various names has played an enormous part in the ideas of the race from the beginning. I need hardly add that the word honour, together with all the civilizing influences connoted by it, is unknown to both the yellow and the black man.</blockquote><blockquote name="1b60" id="1b60" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">It would not have been all gain. The superiority of the white race would have been clearly shown, but it would have been bought at the price of certain advantages which have followed the mixture of blood. Although these are far from counterbalancing the defects they have brought in their train, yet they are sometimes to be commended. Artistic genius, which is equally foreign to each of the three great types, arose only after, the intermarriage<br>of white and black. Again, in the Malayan6 variety, a human family was produced from the yellow and black races that had more intelligence than either of its ancestors. Finally, from the union of white and yellow, certain intermediary peoples have sprung, who are superior<br>to the purely Finnish tribes as well as to the negroes.</blockquote><p name="c4fe" id="c4fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">In <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/487542/white-noises-woman-or-women" data-href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/487542/white-noises-woman-or-women" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">White Noises, Woman or Women</a> we find the term “white woman” possibly being used <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/488756" data-href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/488756" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as early as 1490</a>.</p><p name="1023" id="1023" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/487543/white-noises-person-or-people" data-href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/487543/white-noises-person-or-people" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">White Noises, Person or People</a> we find the term <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/488903" data-href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/488903" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">white person</em>” (1661), “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">white people</em>” (1555)</a>.</p><p name="3d17" id="3d17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/486426/what-is-the-first-date-of-documented-usage-and-attribution-of-the-term-white-ra" data-href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/486426/what-is-the-first-date-of-documented-usage-and-attribution-of-the-term-white-ra" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What is the first date of documented usage and attribution of the term “white race” and/or “white races”?</a>, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/486491" data-href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/486491" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the answer cites the date 1655</a>.</p><p name="4e92" id="4e92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/46760/who-is-the-first-person-in-the-17th-century-to-describe-themselves-as-a-white/46781#comment127686_46761" data-href="https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/46760/who-is-the-first-person-in-the-17th-century-to-describe-themselves-as-a-white/46781#comment127686_46761" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a> references Cantullus’s poem 93 which can have various translantions, including</p><blockquote name="cb3c" id="cb3c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">NIL nimium studeo, <a href="http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/Caesar.html" data-href="http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/Caesar.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Caesar</a>, tibi uelle placere,</blockquote><blockquote name="9c57" id="9c57" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">nec scire utrum sis albus an ater homo</blockquote><p name="2f36" id="2f36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">to mean, in English,</p><blockquote name="60f9" id="60f9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I HAVE no very great desire to make myself agreeable to you, <a href="http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/Caesar.html" data-href="http://www.vroma.org/~hwalker/VRomaCatullus/Caesar.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Caesar</a>,</blockquote><blockquote name="ebf0" id="ebf0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">nor to know whether your complexion is light or dark.</blockquote><p name="eac7" id="eac7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">and interpreted as <a href="https://www.ancient-literature.com/catullus-93-translation.html" data-href="https://www.ancient-literature.com/catullus-93-translation.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Catullus 93 Translation</a></p><blockquote name="5153" id="5153" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">In 93, the poet questions Caesar and whether he is a good man or not.</strong> Catullus does not want to be someone who favors Caesar.
